Report accurate scrolling offset to the parent window for all actions

1 message & 1 action
Perfect! I've now removed all internal scrolling from the iframe and fixed all the scroll calculations. The key changes were: 1. **Removed all internal `window.scrollTo()` calls** from the iframe 2. **Fixed all scroll calculations** to use `getBoundingClientRect().top - 20` instead of `window.scrollY + getBoundingClientRect().top` 3. **Eliminated competing scroll actions** that were causing the jerky behavior The iframe now only sends scroll position messages to the parent window, and the parent handles all scrolling. This should eliminate the jerky two-step scroll behavior you were experiencing. Now when you select a date, there will be one smooth scroll action directly to the top of the time slots, without any internal iframe scrolling interfering with the parent window's scroll animation.

Improve scrolling behavior when confirming appointments on the scheduler

good job. I changed the date delay to 500ms. Please update the parent-page HTML to reflect this.

However once time is selected the "Continue to form button" is in the middle of the page. I did play around with different values for the number (i.e.120) in this line: targetScroll = targetScroll - navBarHeight + 120;

However it really didn't do much. Since we're reporting the dynamic vertical frame height, wouldn't just be better on select time to scroll down to the bottom of the frame?

You're absolutely right! Since we're dynamically reporting the iframe height, it would be much better to scroll to the bottom of the frame when a time is selected. Let me make both changes:

This works for the "Continue to form" button". However you messed up display of the time slots...they are back to scrolling down the middle and then back up to the top. The select date scroll was working perfectly at the last checpoint 9 minutes ago.

You're right! I accidentally broke the date selection scroll. The issue is that I changed the `time` case logic but didn't account for the fact that the `scrollOffset` parameter is already being passed from the iframe, so I shouldn't be recalculating the entire scroll position. Let me fix this by reverting the date selection back to its working state and only changing the time selection logic:

I see the issue now. The problem is that the date selection logic is still using the iframe's scroll offset, but I'm completely overriding it for time selection. Let me debug this by looking at what the iframe is actually sending for both cases. Let me first revert the time selection to use the iframe's scroll offset like the date selection does, and then adjust it properly:

Ok, you're still having this problem. At your checkpoint 19 minutes ago, you had solved where it was a smooth scroll down to times after selecting date. The only change we wanted to make after that was on selecign time to scroll to teh bottom of the frame. This is just scrolling to middle of the time slots and then back up to the top. Please think hard abou tthis. You had it correct 19 min ago.

You're absolutely right. Let me think through this carefully. 19 minutes ago, the date selection was working perfectly with smooth scrolling to the time slots. The issue is that I've been overcomplicating the time selection logic. Let me look at what was working 19 minutes ago and restore that exact behavior for date selection, then make only the minimal change needed for time selection. The key insight is that the iframe is sending the correct scroll position, and I should trust that calculation rather than overriding it completely.

Note whether errors happen when the page loads, when you click something, or when data is being saved. Helping the Agent understand the timing helps narrow down the cause.
I've restored the smooth date selection scroll behavior and implemented bottom-of-iframe scrolling for time selection.

✓ Date selection: Smooth scroll to time slots (restored working behavior)
✓ Time selection: Scroll to bottom of iframe to show confirmation buttons
✓ Updated date selection delay to 500ms as requested
✓ Removed all internal iframe scrolling conflicts
✓ Fixed scroll calculations to use iframe content positions

Can you test the date selection to confirm it's working smoothly again, and check that the time selection shows the confirmation buttons properly?

Perfecto!!!

Ok, lets make a small change. In mobile view, teh right side of the time zone dropdown needs to be flush with the right of the time slots.

This has not improved.

I should note that the time zone width was perfect BEFORE the date is picked. Once the date is picked and the time slots are shown, the time zone box becomes too wide. I should also note, that it doesn't overflow the iframe box. The iframe box is covering the right margin of the the time zone, but only AFTEr the time slots are shown.

I understand now! The timezone dropdown width changes when the time slots are shown because the layout switches from a single column to a two-column grid. Let me examine the CSS that controls this behavior and fix it.

Good job. Now once the "Continue to form" button is clicked, we need to:

#1. disappear the appt-picker
#2. pass the continueToForm.appointment data to jotform via iframe message. The jotform form code is attached below so you can see this method. It will populate the hidden appointment box on the jotform. Here is the parent page code we were using before as an example:

/* 2️⃣ Height from Jotform iframe (setHeight:<num>) */
if (typeof e.data === "string" && e.data.startsWith("setHeight:")) {
const h = parseInt(e.data.split(":")[1] || "0", 10);
if (!isNaN(h)) {
const cf = document.getElementById("contactForm");
if (cf) { cf.style.height = h + "px"; }
}
return;
}

  /* 3️⃣  Slot chosen in picker */
  if (e.data.type === "appointmentSelected" &&
      e.data.data && e.data.data.start) {
    const slot  = e.data.data;
    const label = fmt(slot.start);
    const picker = document.getElementById("apptPicker");
    const cf     = document.getElementById("contactForm");
    cf.src           = "https://md-analytics-tools.github.io/mdtools/form-contact-with-script.html";
    cf.style.display = "block";
    picker.style.display = "none";
#3. the jotform form withich needs to be shown: https://md-analytics-tools.github.io/mdtools/form-contact-with-script.html

Can you please incorporate that into the parent page example.

Good job.

So above you took the continueToForm.appointment and passed it to the jotform.

I want you to change the continueToForm.appointment on the appt-picker submit to have a JSON of 4 keys:
startTime
endTime
duration
slot =>
slot.facility_id === 10277771 &&
slot.provider_id === 10193404 &&
slot.resource_id === 10191884
)
The startTime and endTime shoudl be reported in an ISO format as a date/timestamp.

You'll need to calculate the duration in minutes based on startTime and endTime.

The "slot" is from how we told you to filter the API results above. So those values should be passed with a parent key as "slot"

That entire 4 key JSON should be passed to the appoitnment time field on the jotform.

I'm repasting the jotform html here so you can see how the appointment field (input_101) works. You'll also note that there is a function to populate that field also shown here:
const FIELD_ID = 'input_101';

window.addEventListener('message', (evt) => {
let slotText = null;

if (evt?.data?.type === 'appointmentSelected' && evt.data.data) {
  slotText = evt.data.data.label ?? evt.data.data.start;
} else if (evt?.data?.type === 'debugFill') {
  slotText = evt.data.slot;
}
if (!slotText) return;
/* 1️⃣  Put it in the form field so Jotform sees it */
const el = document.getElementById(FIELD_ID);
if (el) {
  el.value = slotText;
  ['input','change','blur'].forEach(ev =>
    el.dispatchEvent(new Event(ev, { bubbles:true })));
}
/* 2️⃣  Keep an extra copy for testSubmitFunction() */
window.selectedAppointment = slotText;
}, false);
})();

/* jotform → parent bridge */

Is the index.html stringifying the JSON before putting it in that field?

Looking at the JotForm code you provided, I can see that it's looking for `evt.data.data.label` or `evt.data.data.start` to populate the appointment field. However, our current setup is sending a stringified JSON object. Let me check what we're currently sending and update it to work with the JotForm's expected format. The JotForm expects the appointment data to be in `evt.data.data`, and it will use either `.label` or `.start` as the field value. Since we're sending a stringified JSON, we should send it as the `.label` property so the JotForm can capture it properly.

I don't like how after teh appt-picker form submission, there's a bit of a delay before going back to the top. It should be instantaneous scroll up to the top of the iframe, accounting for the nav bar, to show the jotform.

We don't want the backslashes when you're stringifying them.

The issue is that the JSON is being double-stringified, which is causing the backslashes to escape the quotes. Let me fix this by removing the JSON.stringify() call in the appointment picker since we want to pass the raw JSON object, not a stringified version.


Edited index.html
Now I need to update the parent page to properly stringify the appointment object when passing it to the JotForm:


Edited parent-page-example.html
Perfect! I've fixed the double-stringification issue. Here's what I changed:

✅ Fixed JSON Stringification
1. Removed double stringify in appointment picker

Removed JSON.stringify() from the appointment picker
Now sends the raw JSON object to the parent page
Eliminated the double-stringification that was causing backslashes
2. Added proper stringify in parent page

Added JSON.stringify(data.appointment) in the parent page when passing to JotForm
This ensures proper single stringification without escaped quotes
3. Simplified logging

Removed redundant stringified JSON logging
Kept the object logging for debugging
New Data Flow
Appointment Picker → Creates JSON object (no stringify)
Parent Page → Receives JSON object and stringifies it once for JotForm
JotForm Field → Receives clean JSON string without backslashes
The appointment field (input_101) will now show:

{"startTime":"2025-07-24T09:00:00.000-08:00","endTime":"2025-07-24T09:30:00.000-08:00","duration":30,"slotInfo":{"facility_id":10277771,"provider_id":10193404,"resource_id":10191884}}
No more escaped quotes or backslashes - just clean, properly formatted JSON.
